# Preparation

> [!tip] Tip
> These are things that can be done in advance, and in any order, to make following the guide easier. It should be clear if these preparatory steps are optional or required.

- **This is an optional step that could be done.**
  This is an explanation of why the optional step should be, or not be, done and how to do it. If this step gets to be pretty complicated, consider breaking it out into a separate guide and linking to it from here.
- ==**This is a required step that must be done.**==
  This is just like the optional step, but it has been highlighted as a way to indicate that the step is required before starting the guide.

# Obstacles

> [!tip] Tip
> These are things that could hinder following the guide and are being made known up front to prepare yourself. Each obstacle mentioned should indicate if there is a way to recover, or you should stop following the guide and do something else.

- **This is a recoverable obstacle.**
  This is an explanation of what the obstacle is, how it can be encountered and recognized while following the guide, and what can be done to recover from it.
- ==**This is an unrecoverable obstacle.**==
  This is like the recoverable obstacle, but an explanation is instead provided on why you cannot recover and, ideally, what you should be doing instead. While fatal to this guide, it may serve as an indication that this guide does not apply.

# Steps

1. This is the first step to achieve the desired result.

# Result

This is an explanation of what the expected result should be. If there were any missteps that could have prevented you from achieving the desired result, they should be documented under [[#Obstacles]] and optionally mentioned from here.
